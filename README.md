# MarineFoodWeb

The objective of this research is to analyse the complexity and structure of the largest set of highly-resolved marine food webs.

Partial results of such research were done in the framework of the School for International Training (SIT) program "People, Environment, and Climate Change in Patagonia and Antarctica" (https://studyabroad.sit.edu/program/spring-2022-argentina-people-environment-and-climate-change-in-patagonia-and-antarctica/#dlos). A college-level piece of work was presented in June 2022.
